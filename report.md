# Lab 1 Report

In this lab, I created a Git repository and set up a simple web page using HTML. I also managed branches and committed changes with clear messages.

## Steps:
1. Initialized a Git repository.
2. Created the necessary files (`student-info.txt`, `report.md`, `index.html`).
3. Managed branches and made meaningful commits.
4. Deployed the HTML page to GitHub Pages.
